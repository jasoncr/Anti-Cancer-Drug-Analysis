# matplotlib-challenge

In this challenge I took on the role of a data analyst working a pharmaceutical company which was testing their anti-cancer drug regimen vs other drug regimens. I did this analysis in a Jupyter notebook and utilized Python, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. I loaded in 2 .csvs to merge together and then cleaned the data so I could do effective calculations and visualizations. In order to get a handle on the situation, the first thing I did was do a summary of the tumor volumes by drug regimen.
